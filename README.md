# Visualize ensemble performance

[Ensemble Testbed](https://ekellbuch-ensemble-testbed-web-appensemble-gains-app-bvdca2.streamlit.app/) is an interactive website to visualize ensemble performance from open source models.

The models used to form the ensembles come from the following sources:
1. [ImageNet Testbed](https://github.com/modestyachts/imagenet-testbed)
2. [Pytorch Ensembles](https://github.com/SamsungLabs/pytorch-ensembles)

[docs/README](docs/README.md) has instructions to add models (logits and labels) and visualize ensemble metrics.
